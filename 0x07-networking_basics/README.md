# Networking Basics

This repository provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental networking concepts. Whether you're new to networking or looking for a quick reference, this collection covers key topics, providing clear definitions and insights into various aspects of computer networks.

## Topics Covered

### 1. OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system. It consists of seven layers, each serving specific purposes:

- **Physical Layer:** Deals with the physical transmission of data.
- **Data Link Layer:** Responsible for node-to-node communication within a network.
- **Network Layer:** Manages routing and forwarding of data.
- **Transport Layer:** Ensures end-to-end communication.
- **Session Layer:** Manages sessions or connections between applications.
- **Presentation Layer:** Deals with data translation and encryption.
- **Application Layer:** Provides a user interface and network services.

### 2. LAN (Local Area Network)

A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network of interconnected computers and devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or campus. 

- **Typical Usage:** LANs are commonly used for sharing resources like files, printers, and internet connections among connected devices.
- **Typical Geographical Size:** Usually spans a relatively small area, like a single building or a group of nearby buildings.

### 3. WAN (Wide Area Network)

A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a network that covers a broad area, often connecting multiple LANs or other networks across long distances.

- **Typical Usage:** WANs facilitate communication and data exchange between geographically separated entities, such as branch offices of a company.
- **Typical Geographical Size:** Spans a large geographical area, potentially covering cities, countries, or even continents.

### 4. Internet

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and networks that communicate using standardized protocols.

### 5. IP Address

An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

- **Two Types of IP Addresses:** IPv4 (32-bit address) and IPv6 (128-bit address).

### 6. Localhost

Localhost refers to the loopback address, typically represented as 127.0.0.1. It allows a device to access its network services without using the network itself.

### 7. Subnet

A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network, dividing it into smaller, manageable segments to improve performance and security.

### 8. IPv6

IPv6 was created to address the limitations of IPv4, primarily the exhaustion of available IP addresses.

### 9. TCP/UDP

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication with error checking and retransmission.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Offers faster, connectionless communication with no error recovery.

### 10. Difference between TCP and UDP

TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication, while UDP offers faster, connectionless communication with no error recovery.

### 11. Port

A port is a communication endpoint in an operating system, associated with a specific process or service.

### 12. SSH, HTTP, HTTPS Port Numbers

- **SSH:** Port 22
- **HTTP:** Port 80
- **HTTPS:** Port 443

### 13. Tool/Protocol for Network Connectivity

Ping (using the ICMP protocol) is often used to check if a device is connected to a network.
