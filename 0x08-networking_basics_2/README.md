# Networking Concepts and Commands

This repository provides a brief overview of essential networking concepts and commonly used commands. Whether you're a beginner or looking for quick reference material, this collection covers key topics in computer networking.

## Topics Covered

1. **Localhost / 127.0.0.1:**
   - **Localhost:** Refers to the current device and is commonly used to access network services on the host itself.
   - **127.0.0.1:** The loopback IP address, allowing communication with the local machine without affecting network traffic.

2. **0.0.0.0:**
   - A special IP address indicating "any" or "all addresses," often used to bind a service or server to all available network interfaces on the host.

3. **/etc/hosts:**
   - The `/etc/hosts` file is a text file on Unix-like operating systems used to map hostnames to IP addresses. It allows local overrides of DNS settings.

4. **Display Active Network Interfaces:**
   - Use the following commands to display active network interfaces:
     - Using `ifconfig` (older systems):
       ```bash
       ifconfig
       ```
     - Using `ip` (newer systems):
       ```bash
       ip addr show
       ```
     These commands provide information about active network interfaces, including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and other details.
